Everyone’s tech journey starts somewhere.Mine started in **2020**, the day a desktop computer was brought into our home.At first, it wasn’t anything serious. I was just playing around with it—clicking things, exploring, being curious. I didn’t really understand what computers could *do* beyond the basics we learned in school: what a computer is, what a mouse is, and the physical parts of a machine. Software still felt like a mystery to me.


But that changed through conversations with my brother.One of my elder brothers studied IT, and during our talks, he started telling me about **coding**, **software**, and how people actually build websites and applications. That was the first time I realized:

> “Wait… people can actually *create* the things we use on computers?”

That idea stuck with me.

So I started searching online:  
“How to learn programming?”  
“How to build websites?”  
“What language should I start with?”

Almost everywhere, I saw the same advice: **Start with HTML if you want to build websites.**

## Discovering Online Learning

Around that time, I stumbled upon a platform called **ALX** (a tech learning platform from Kenya, if I’m not mistaken). Back in 2020, they were offering a **free software engineering course**.

I was still in high school.  
I didn’t know anything about programming.  
I barely knew anything about software at all.

But I signed up anyway.

That’s where things started to feel real.

We learned about:
- The history of computers  
- Basic computing concepts  
- And gradually, more technical topics  

I remember working with **PuTTY**, using it like a shell, and learning **basic Linux commands**. That was my first real exposure to the command line. It felt confusing… but also exciting. For the first time, I wasn’t just *using* a computer—I was starting to **understand** it.

## My First Steps into Programming

After that, I moved on to:
- **HTML** for building simple web pages  
- Then the **C programming language**  

This was a big jump for me.

Suddenly, there were:
- Syntax rules  
- Errors I didn’t understand  
- Programs that refused to compile  
- And a lot of moments where nothing worked  

It honestly became overwhelming.

At some point, I got stuck. It felt like **too much, too fast**. So I did what many beginners do…

I took a break.

## Coming Back Stronger

About one to two years later, I came back.

This time, I returned to:
- **C again**
- Then **C++**
- And programming started to make more sense than before

Around this period, the ALX platform introduced **new, modern courses**. The only difference was: this time, they were **paid**.

I was lucky enough to get someone to help me pay the fee so I could enroll.

Thanks to that, I got access to the platform for 3 years, and that changed everything.

## Going Deeper into Tech

From there, my learning became much more structured. I started studying:

- Foundations of **web development**  
- **CSS** and **JavaScript**  
- **UI testing**  
- **Figma** and **UI/UX design**  
- **Low-level programming**  
- **System architecture** and **system design**  
- **Database design** with **SQLite** and **PostgreSQL**  

It became:
> Tutorial after tutorial.  
> Website after website.  
> Project after project.

Slowly, things that once looked impossible started to feel… normal.

## Where I Am Now

Today, my stack includes:
- React  
- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  

And now, I’m taking the next big step: **transitioning into AI Engineering**.

This blog—and my content in general—is about documenting that journey honestly:
- The wins  
- The confusion  
- The mistakes  
- The growth  

## Final Thoughts

Looking back, it’s crazy to think that all of this started with **one computer in 2020** and simple curiosity.

I’m still learning.  
I’m still building.  
And I’m still at the beginning of a much bigger journey.

But this time, I’m not just exploring tech.

I’m **building a future with it**.
